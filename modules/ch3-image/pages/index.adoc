= Deploy MicroShift on RHEL Image Mode

Goal::
Add MicroShift to bootc container images.

WARNING: Work In Progress.

== Introduction

This chapter explores the requirements for building and deploying bootc containers which include MicroShift, as supported by Red Hat build of MicroShift, including the caveats applicable to air-gaped environments.

The hands-on activities also build an installation ISO for disconnected environment.

IMPORTANT: Most details about installing and configuring MicroShift are explained in the xref:ch2-package[previous chapter].
While you could perform all hands-on activities here without doing the previous chapter, you may lack essential concepts and troubleshooting guidance for managing MicroShift instances.
