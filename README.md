# Deploying MicroShift on RHEL Image Mode Quick Course

This course teaches how to deploy and configure MicroShift on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), using package mode or image mode,to support Kubernetes applications.

Sample applications and configuration files are in the [rhde-build-samples](https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/tree/main) repository.

The course design is loosely based on the [RHEL for Edge variant of this course](https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-microshift/). Both courses share content on package mode a.k.a traditional RHEL and MicroShift concepts. If you must make updates and fixes for generic MicroShift content, make them in the other course.

Design docs from the RHEL for Edge variant are available to Red Hat employees only, for reference:

// Not sure about exposing the internal URL to GitHub repo.

Figures on this course are designed using Google Slides, and the deck is available to Red Hat employees. Individual slides are exported to SVG files and cleaned using Inkscape. Those files are in the git repository.
