= Summary

In this chapter, you learned:

* Image mode for RHEL supports preconfiguring MicroShift and Kubernetes applications at bootc conainer image build time and also supports deploying Kubernetes applications on day 2 using Kubernetes APIs.

* You must configure your Containerfile to access your private or mirror registries by editing configuration files during the container image build process.

* Containerfile ADD, COPY and RUN instructions are suitable for small configuration files, and you can create custom RPM packages for larger and binary files.

* If you embed MicroShift and application container images in your bootc container images, by using physically bound conainers, you can provision edge devices and run edge applications without requiring any access to remote container registries.

* Once your edge device, running MicroShift, is provisioned, you can configure and access its MicroShift instance the same way you would do for RHEL package mode.
