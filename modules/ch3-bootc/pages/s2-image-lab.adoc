= Lab: Create Bootc Container Images with MicroShift

_Estimated reading time: *{time_estimate} minutes*._

Objective::

Provision a RHEL image mode system with MicroShift, fully disconnected, from an installation ISO.

WARNING: Work In Progress

IMPORTANT: Rewrite this as needed for image mode, may extract pieces to partials if they fit both RPM-OSTree and bootc

== Before you Begin

You need a few machines to perform the hands-on activities in this course. 

* A _development machine_ with RHEL and unrestricted `sudo`, where you will install Image Builder and RPM-OSTree tools, create KVM VMs using Libvirt, and also run the OpenShift client to access your MicroShift instances in other machines.

* A _package server machine_ already configured to serve DNF repositories for RHEL, Fast Datapath for RHEL, and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

* A _web server machine_ with RHEL and unrestricted `sudo`, to host OSTree repositories

* A _mirror registry machine_ with RHEL and unrestricted `sudo`, already populated with the container images required by MicroShift and sample applications.

Make sure that your _package server machine_ and _mirror registry machine_ are properly configured and verified by following the instructions from the xref:ch1-microshift:s3-air-gapped-lab.adoc[previous lab] of this course.

These instructions were tested on RHEL 9.5 but should work with minimal or no change on newer and older RHEL 9.x releases.

If you are using the course environment, you will log in to the `workstation` VM as the user `student` with password `student`. The `workstation` VM is your _development machine_. You will start SSH sessions from the `workstation` VM to the `servera` VM, which is your _web server machine_ and also your _mirror registry machine_, using the same user.

You will also create a local KVM virtual machine on your _development machine_, and we refer to that VM as your _edge machine_.

IMPORTANT: Be sure you execute each step on the correct machine. If a step is not explicit about the machine it should be performed, it is using the same machine as its previous step.

== Instructions

1. On your _development machine_, verify that you have all prerequisites from previous labs.

.. Check that the Image Builder service is running and your unprivileged user has access to it.

.. Check that output from the previous command shows that the mirror registry is already populated with MicroShift release images (`openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev`) and LVM Storage operator images (`lvms4/lvms-rhel9-operator`).

2. Configure the Image Builder service to use the mirror registry.

.. Create an Image Builder worker configuration file that refers to credentials for accessing the mirror registry.
+
IMPORTANT: You already configured your _development machine_ with CA certificates and credentials to access the mirror registry in a xref:ch1-microshift:s3-air-gapped-lab.adoc[previous lab].
+

EOF*
$ *sudo cp osbuild-worker.toml /etc/osbuild-worker/osbuild-worker.toml*
$ *sudo cp mirror-pull-secret /etc/osbuild-worker/containers-auth.json*
--

.. Configure the container runtime to get MicroShift release images from the mirror registry.
+
NOTE: The registry configuration file is the same one you already used to configure MicroShift in a xref:ch2-package:s2-install-lab[previous lab].

$ *sudo cp 999-microshift-mirror.conf /etc/containers/registries.conf.d*
--

.. Disable signature verification on container images required by MicroShift by downloading a https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/blob/main/microshift/containers-policy.json.nosigs[container image policy file/ from the course samples git repository.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]

$ *sudo cp containers-policy.json.nosigs /etc/containers/policy.json*
--

.. Reboot your _development machine_ so its Image Builder service reads its new configuration files.
+
// Restarting osbuild is tricky. there's an unknown number of workers to stop and a cache to clean
// https://github.com/openshift/microshift/blob/main/scripts/devenv-builder/cleanup-composer.sh#L64-L99

3. Configure the Image Builder service with package sources for the RPM repositories required by MicroShift

.. Download the package sources TOML files from the https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/tree/main/sources[course samples git repository].
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/refs/heads/main/sources/openshift.toml*
$ *wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/refs/heads/main/sources/fastdata.toml*
--

.. Configure your Image Builder service with the additional package sources.
+
These package sources refer to the same RPM repositories that you already used in the xref:ch2-package:s2-install-lab.adoc[previous chapter] to deploy MicroShift on package-based RHEL.
+

4. Download and inspect an Image Builder blueprint for a preconfigured MicroShift instance.

.. Download the https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/blob/main/blueprints/rhel9-microshift.toml[sample blueprint] from the course samples git repository. It is a long blueprint but, assuming that you performed all activities from the https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/rhde-build/[first Red Hat Device Edge course] and also from the xref:ch2-package[previous chapter] of this course, there should be no surprises.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/refs/heads/main/blueprints/rhel9-microshift.toml*
--

.. Review the `rhel9-microshift.toml` blueprint and make sure you understand its customizations:
+
NOTE: The code snippets here help you locate the relevant sections in the blueprint, but they do not list the entirety of most sections. Follow along with a text editor and navigate through the blueprint file.

... Set the hostname to `ushift` where the letter "u" stands for the Greek letter "micro".

... Embed a script which copies the autogenerated kubeconfig files to the `core` user home directory.
+
[source,subs="verbatim"]
--
include::1@samples:blueprints:example$rhel9-microshift.toml[lines=157..158]
...
--
+
NOTE: The script starts before MicroShift is fully initialized so it was coded to wait until MicroShift autogenerates the kubeconfig files.

... Invoke the previous script from another first boot service.
+
[source,subs="verbatim"]
--
include::1@samples:blueprints:example$rhel9-microshift.toml[lines=174..175]
...
--

5. Build an edge system image.

.. Add the CA certificate for the mirror registry to the blueprint. Because it was generated when you installed the mirror registry in a xref:ch1-microshift:s3-air-gapped-lab.adoc[previous lab], we cannot have it in the course samples repository.
+
Open the `rhel9-microshift.toml` file in a text editor and replace the `REPLACE_QUAY_CA` text with the entire contents of the `quay-rootCA.pem` file.
+

.. Push the blueprint and check that Image Builder can resolve all RPM packages from it.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
--
$ *composer-cli blueprints push rhel9-microshift.toml*
$ *composer-cli blueprints depsolve rhel9-microshift | grep microshift*

--
+
NOTE: If you get errors related to downloading container images, it is probably because you forgot to reboot your _development machine_ after configuring it for accessing the mirror registry.

.. Start a compose for an edge commit image.
+
Save the UUID of the compose in a shell variable so you can use it in other commands.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
--
$ *composer-cli compose start-ostree rhel9-microshift edge-commit --ref rhel/9/x86_64/ushift*

--
$ *wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/refs/heads/main/ks/rhel9-microshift-installer.ks*
--

.. Review the `rhel9-microshift-installer.ks` kickstart and make sure you understand it's instructions.
+
NOTE: The code snippets here help you locate the relevant sections in the kickstart file, but they do not list the entirety of the file. Follow along with a text editor and navigate through the kickstart file.

... Partition the root disk with LVM, but taking only 10G for the root partition, in order to leave empty space in the `rhel` volume group for use by MicroShift's LVM Storage operator.

+
NOTE: Production systems would NOT enable password login. We left it here as a convenience for the learner, so you can log in at the VM console for troubleshooting.

.. Create an SSH key for use with your edge devices.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *ssh-keygen -N '' -f edge-key -C 'initial key for edge devices'*
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
...
--
+
NOTE: If you get an error, because you already have an `edge-key` generated from previous Red Hat Device Edge courses, just ignore the error and continue with the next step.

.. Embed your new SSH key in the kickstart file.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *SSH_PUB_KEY=$( cat edge-key.pub )*
$ *sed -i "s|REPLACE_WTH_SSH_PUB_KEY|$SSH_PUB_KEY|" rhel9-microshift-installer.ks*
--

8. Build an edge installer image and download it as an ISO file.

.. Push the blueprint for your edge installer image.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *composer-cli blueprints push rhel9-microshift-installer.toml*
--

.. Start a compose for your edge installer image.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
--
$ *composer-cli compose start-ostree microshift-installer edge-installer --ref rhel/9/x86_64/ushift --url http://servera.lab.example.com/repo/*

10. On your _web server machine_, stop the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift, so you can prove that your edge installer image can actually work in disconnected edge sites.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo systemctl stop quay-app quay-pod quay-redis*
$ *sudo systemctl is-active quay-app quay-pod quay-redis*

+
NOTE: The `failed` state is expected for the `quay-app` service.

11. On your _development machine_, create a KVM virtual machine to test your edge installer image.

.. Set a shell variable with the disk label of your installer image, by copy-and-paste from the output of the `iso-info` command.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *iso-info rhel9-microshift.iso*

Volume      : RHEL-9-5-0-BaseOS-x86_64
No Joliet extensions
$ *LABEL=RHEL-9-5-0-BaseOS-x86_64*
--

.. Create a KVM virtual machine from your installer image. The installation should proceed unattended until you get a login prompt. 
+
You could use different `virt-install` commands or the Cockpit web UI. The use of `--location` and `--extra-arg` in the following command enables the VM to run with a serial console, so you don't need to leave your shell and don't need to open a graphical console for your _edge machine_.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *virt-install --name edge-microshift-1 --os-variant rhel9.5 \

--location /home/student/rhel9-microshift.iso \
--extra-arg inst.ks=hd:LABEL=$LABEL:/rhel9-microshift-installer.ks \
--extra-arg console=ttyS0 -v*
...
ushift login:
--
+
NOTE: You may need to press kbd:[Enter] to see the login prompt, after the VM stops displaying console messages.

.. Detach from the VM console, by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+\]], and start an SSH session to your _edge machine_.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *ssh -i edge-key core@ushift*
--

12. On your _edge machine_, verify that MicroShift is fully initialized.

.. Check that MicroShift is healthy and all its pods are ready and running. Beware it may take a while for MicroShift to finish starting all its pods.

NOTE: If you are too quick, you may get a `NotReady` state from `oc get node`, or a "no resources found" error from `oc get pod`. If any of this happens, just wait a few seconds and try again.

.. As an additional check, create a test pod from the sample application image we included in the blueprint.

IMPORTANT: If you create a pod with the default image pull policy of `Always` it will fail because we stopped the mirror registry.

You succeed in provisioning an edge device, from an edge installer image, in an air-gapped environment: you only need the installation media to fully provision a ready-to-use RHEL for Edge system running a MicroShift instance.


// May need cleanup in case of errors, similar to:

== What's Next

This was the final activity of this course. If you wish, you can create service accounts and kubeconfig files for developer access using the same steps from ch2-package:s3-access-lab.adoc[previous labs] already demonstrated on package-based RHEL.
